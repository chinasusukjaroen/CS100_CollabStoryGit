Once upon a time, in a land far, far away...
When i went to the sea,i saw the whale that was beached during neap tide,Heartbroken beneath the sea.
And I lie on sand beneath the sun. Watching the clouds float across the sky.
I saw bird that fly in the sky with freedom.
And then I walk back to my house and take a sleep.
